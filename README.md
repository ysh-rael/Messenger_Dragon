# Messenger Dragon


## About
> Messenger Dragon, a bot created to manage and store your to-do list created by [telegram icon]. 
The central idea is a list of tasks that can be used by the browser or the desktop app, made in Javascript.
> This bot is intended to help you manipulate and store in Telegram itself, preventing data loss, or improper access to them, taking up too much space on the user's device memory.

> None of your data is stored, as only the information obtained from your Telegram chat with the bot itself is used (like your nikename, chat id, group name etc...) being enough to recognize who is you and rescue the corresponding task list.

> This is an authorial project, created with the objective of study and learning. The purpose of this project is to use some previous projects and use them to satisfy a need.

> The idea for the project came about due to the need for a small and quick to-do list while developing, to record ideas or small changes I made/would make, or places in the code I messed with. I didn't like notepad, since every time I wanted to recover I would have to go get the saved file, which annoyed me a lot, in addition to filling my HD (hard disk) with several "without name.txt" files, which made it difficult to find what I was looking for . Another problem encountered was the need for this to-do list to be accessed anywhere quickly, as I often end up thinking of a possible solution in very random places and that I often don't have my pc close by to test and that without a doubt, I will forget later.

Here are the main technologies used in this project.

## How to use
Enter your telegram, search for user @DragonMoonlightMessengerBot and start the conversation (/start). a numeric code will be generated, in which attention must be paid to the hyphens that are part of the code. also note that when copying the code it should not have any blanks as it will result in "invalid code". After generating the code, you can access the list by the following means:
 
 > ### By desktop APP
 > To use as a desktop application, we will use nativefiers to generate an application. 
 > Install Nativefier globally with ```npm install -g nativefier``` .  
 > Requirements:
 > * macOS 10.10+ / Windows / Linux </br>
 > * Node.js ≥ 12.9 and npm ≥ 6.9 <br>
 > With nativefier properly installed, we will run the following in the terminal
 >		```nativefier --name 'MessengerDragon' 'https://messenger-dragon.herokuapp.com/'```
 > Check the home folder (main folder), a folder named "MessengerDragon" will be generated. Inside the folder look for the 'MessengerDragon' file and run it.
 
 
 > ### By browser
 > Go to [https://messenger-dragon.herokuapp.com/](https://messenger-dragon.herokuapp.com/)
 
 
 After entering, enter the code you copied there on Telegram. If the code is correct, you will be redirected to your task list access page.

 Note that if you want, you can request a new code, restarting the Bot (/start), in which you will not lose access to your list nor will the items in it be reset.
 The first item will be the name of your list, after adding it, the bot will send a message with that name. It will use this message to store its list. The message will be edited whenever a list item is added, deleted or edited. Thus preventing you from being annoyed with excessive notifications.
